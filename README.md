# 🌌 Virtual Cosmos

A real-time 2D proximity-based social space where users interact naturally based on distance — just like in real life.

---

## 🚀 Overview

**Virtual Cosmos** is a multiplayer web application where users move in a shared 2D environment and automatically connect with others nearby.

- Move closer → Chat appears  
- Move away → Chat disappears  

This creates a **spatial, immersive communication experience** similar to real-world interactions.

## 🧠 How Proximity Logic Works

Each player continuously sends their position to the server.

The frontend calculates distance using:

```
distance = √((x2 - x1)² + (y2 - y1)²)
```

If:

```
distance < PROXIMITY_RADIUS
```

Then:

* Player is considered "near"
* Chat UI becomes active
* Player turns 🟡 yellow

Otherwise:

* Player is "far"
* Chat hides
* Player turns 🔵 blue

---

## 🧪 How to Test

1. Open the app in **2+ browser tabs**
2. Enter different usernames
3. Move players closer together
4. Observe:

   * Color changes
   * Chat appearing/disappearing
   * Real-time sync
